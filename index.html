<h1>Cardano Straight ADA Stakepool</h1>

The "Cardano Straight ADA Stakepool" aims to secure the Cardano network by running a competitive 24/7 pool on decentralized infrastructure maintained by IT professionals. The fees ensure longevity of the pool, there is no other purpose, thus the name of our pool. This pool does not aim to cure or heal the world, I just intend to provide reliable Cardano infrastructure / protocol service with high desirability for you as a delegator.

<h3>About the operator</h3>
I am an IT professional with many years of experience in maintaining servers. I run a few servers for fun, this stakepool is another one of those. As a technical person, I was drawn to Cardano and am happy to provide this service to the community.

<h3>About the pool itself</h3>
The pool is run off a reliable, redundant virtual private server located in Europe / Germany, within the stable minimum hardware requirements specified by IOHK.

<h3>Fee structure</h3> 
Before you receive your delegation reward by the Cardano protocol a 5% fee is deducted. That's it, I hope you do find this competitive. Running a stakepool must be worth it, or everyone would just delegate to a central server and we lose one of the core goals of Cardano: Decentralization.

I will not suddenly raise my fees like what other pools starting at 0% will eventually do. As a delegator I want to give you peace of mind delegating to my pool.

<h3>Updates</h3>
Updates will be posted here, should there be any. There are no plans for any changes to the fee structure during the incentivized testnet duration. 

<p>Currently, there are also no plans to setup a mailing list for delegators as it is plausible Shelley mainnet will have some form of wallet messaging in the official wallets from stakepool operator to stakepool delegators. We have enough email spam already, I would like to minimize any further spam by not contributing to collect yet another mailing list prone to abuse.</p>

<h3>Name origin</h3>
