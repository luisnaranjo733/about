          <h4 class="mt-4">What is your mission statement?</h4>
          <p>The "Cardano Straight ADA Stakepool" aims to secure the Cardano network by running a competitive 24/7 pool on decentralized infrastructure maintained by IT professionals. The low fees ensure longevity and sustainability of the pool, there is no other purpose, thus the name of our pool. This pool intention is to provide reliable Cardano infrastructure / protocol service with high desirability for you as a delegator. 
          </p>
          STR8 pool highly appreciates anyone already delegating to us or planning to do so. We will do our best to get you the rewards you deserve for being an early adopter of Cardano!
          It is risk free to delegate your stake, consider delegating to STR8 today to earn rewards.

          <h4 class="mt-4">What are the three core values of your stake pool?</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Reliability - Delegators can trust that our pool performs 24/7</li>
            <li>Honesty - We are an honest participant of the network, we vow to never never cheat or exploit the protocol</li>
            <li>Openness - We will never hide anything from delegators, even if it makes us look bad. We aim for transparency</li>
          </ol>

          <h4 class="mt-4">Who operates this pool?</h4>
          <p>I am an IT professional with computer science background, with many years in the IT business.</p>
          <p>Whilst running and maintaining servers is just a hobby of mine, I engage in this way with multiple communities in see value in. I bring many years of experience in maintaining Linux based servers. Running a pool is more fun to me than a serious challenge.
          <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this pool you can find me in Telegram under the name @Slacker1 in all the relevant Cardano channels.</p>
          
          <h4 class="mt-4">What is your history with the Cardano project?</h4>
          <p>As a technical person, I was drawn to Cardano in 2017 through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja9D0kpksxw">Charles' whiteboard video</a> and have followed the protocol ever since, watching AMAs and the like almost every day on the way to work and back.</p> 
          <p>I see a lot of potential in Cardano due to its' strong vision and methodical process, so I am very happy to provide the service of running a reliable stakepool for the community fostering network growth & strength.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">What is the setup of your pool?</h4>
          <p>The pool is run off a reliable, redundant virtual private server located in Europe / crypto-friendly Germany with an SLA of 99.95%, with hardware spec double the stable minimum hardware requirements specified by IOHK ensuring smooth operation.</p> 
          <p>The pool is running on Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS with 2 cores, 8 GB RAM, 80 GB HDD and 100 Mbps internet with no cap.</p>
          <p>I do not want to bore you with elaborate real-time monitoring data of my pool, you can just expect that the pool works for you 24/7. Of course within the testnet the pool can only run as stable as the software stability allows, but I will do my best and moving forward code stability will improve for sure.</p> 
    
          <h4 class="mt-4">What are your plans for the future of your pool?</h4>
          <p>I am running this pool because I believe in Cardano's future and want to be a part of it. For this reason, I plan to run this pool indefinitely. I will try my best to keep the pool performing the best it can. 

          <p>I am currently very active in the <a href="https://t.me/CardanoStakePoolWorkgroup">Cardano Shelley Testnet & StakePool Best Practice Workgroup Telegram group</a> trying to help grow the community and implement all best practices for this pool and develop new best practices along the way.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">Why should I delegate to your pool?</h4>
          <p>My hope is that my pool has high desirability for you as a delegator. I am committed to run this pool indefinitely with reasonable but low fees for testnet as well as mainnet. I am an IT professional so you can be assured I always have all best practices in place.</p> 
          <p>I decided to build only on the profit margin, not the pool costs, to run the infrastructure. So there will never be any fixed costs at this pool. My reason is solidarity with you, my highly appreciated delegator. By relying soly on profit margin, we share the risk. I believe in Cardano and we are in this together. If your stake is doing well, the pool reward is going well. We share the good days, we share the bad days.</p>
          <p>The pool profit margin is merely 4% of your reward, you keep 96% of your reward. Please note we are talking about reward, not your staking amount.</p>
          <p>I will not suddenly raise my fees like what other pools starting with unsustainable fee structures will eventually do. As a delegator I want to give you peace of mind delegating to my pool all the way from testnet on to mainnet.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">Where do I get updates on this pool?</h4>
          <p>Updates are posted on <a href="https://twitter.com/Straightpool4">Twitter</a> and in the <a href="https://t.me/str8pool">Straightpool Telegram group</a>.</p>
          <p>Currently, there are no plans to setup a mailing list for delegators as it is plausible Shelley mainnet will have some form of wallet messaging in the official wallets from stakepool operator to stakepool delegators. We have enough email spam already, I would like to minimize any further spam by not contributing to collect yet another mailing list prone to abuse.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">What is the name origin of this pool?</h4>
          <p>Straight in the sense of straightforward, straight ahead, straight high quality audio, no gimmicks, just works.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">Where can I learn more about all of this?</h4>
