          <h4 class="mt-4">What is your mission statement?</h4>
          <p>The "Cardano Straight ADA Stakepool" aims to secure the Cardano network by running a competitive 24/7 pool on decentralized infrastructure maintained by IT professionals. The low fees ensure longevity and sustainability of the pool, there is no other purpose, thus the name of our pool. This pool intention is to provide reliable Cardano infrastructure / protocol service with high desirability for you as a delegator. 
          </p>
          STR8 pool highly appreciates anyone already delegating to us or planning to do so. We will do our best to get you the rewards you deserve for being an early adopter of Cardano!
          It is risk free to delegate your stake, consider delegating to STR8 today to earn rewards.

          <h4 class="mt-4">What are the three core values of your stake pool?</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Reliability - Delegators can trust that our pool performs 24/7</li>
            <li>Honesty - We are an honest participant of the network, we vow to never never cheat or exploit the protocol</li>
            <li>Openness - We will never hide anything from delegators, even if it makes us look bad. We aim for transparency</li>
          </ol>

          <h4 class="mt-4">Who operates this pool?</h4>
          <p>I am Chris, a German IT professional with computer science background, with many years in the IT business.</p>
          <p>Whilst running and maintaining servers is just a hobby of mine, I engage in this way with multiple communities in see value in. I bring many years of experience in maintaining Linux based servers. Running a pool is more fun to me than a serious challenge.
          <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this pool you can find me in Telegram under the name @ChrisSTR8 in all the relevant Cardano channels.</p>
          
          <h4 class="mt-4">What is your history with the Cardano project?</h4>
          <p>As a technical person, I was drawn to Cardano in 2017 through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja9D0kpksxw">Charles' whiteboard video</a> and have followed the protocol ever since, watching AMAs and the like almost every day on the way to work and back.</p> 
          <p>I see a lot of potential in Cardano due to its' strong vision and methodical process, so I am very happy to provide the service of running a reliable stakepool for the community fostering network growth & strength.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">What is the setup of your pool?</h4>
          <p>The pool is run off four reliable, redundant virtual private servers, one block producer, one block producer backup and two relays distributed across different data centers in Europe / Germany and Asia / Singapore.</p>
          <p>All nodes run on a modern secure Server OS with ample hardware resources and strong peering with easy scaling options to meet rising demands.</p>
          <p>I do not want to bore you with elaborate real-time monitoring data of my pool, you can just expect that the pool works for you 24/7.</p> 
    
          <h4 class="mt-4">What are your plans for the future of your pool?</h4>
          <p>I am running this pool because I believe in Cardano's future and want to be a part of it. For this reason, I plan to run this pool indefinitely. I will try my best to keep the pool performing the best it can. 

          <p>I am active in the <a href="https://t.me/CardanoStakePoolWorkgroup">Cardano Shelley Testnet & StakePool Best Practice Workgroup Telegram group</a> trying to help grow the community and implement all best practices for this pool and develop new best practices along the way.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">Why should I delegate to your pool?</h4>
          <p>My hope is that my pool has high desirability for you as a delegator. I am committed to run this pool indefinitely with reasonable but low fees. I am an IT professional so you can be assured I always have all best practices in place.</p> 
          <p>The pool profit margin is effectively only 4% of your reward, you keep 96% of your reward. Please note we are talking about reward, not your staking amount. STR8 applies a dynamic variable fee to circumvent the fixed mandatory fee of 340 ADA per epoch.
          </p>
          <p>I will not suddenly raise my variable fees above 4% like what other pools starting with unsustainable fee structures will eventually do. As a delegator I want to give you peace of mind delegating to my pool.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">What do you mean by an "effective" variable fee of 4%?</h4>
          <p>I do not agree taking a fixed fee of 340 ADA independent of the number of blocks STR8 pool produces. My reason is solidarity with you, my highly appreciated delegator. By relying only on profit margin, we share the risk. I believe in Cardano and we are in this together. STR8 pool shares the good and bad days with its delegators by relying solely on the variable fee. To run a sustainable pool, STR8 requires merely 4.0% of effective variable fee.</p>
          <p>
          Starting out we start with a variable fee of 0% and the mandatory fixed fee of 340 ADA per epoch (in case of at least one produced block). 
          Each epoch STR8 will calculate the effective fee gained by the fixed fee of 340 ADA per epoch and keep the customizable variable fee at 0% as long as the effective fee meets the minimum of 4.0% effective variable fee.
          </p>
          <p>
           Each time the effective variable fee drops for 3 consecutive epochs at least 0.5 points below 4.0%, the variable pool fee will be increased by at least 0.5 points to a maximum of 4.0%. At no point the variable fee is decreased again after it has been increased. When STR8 pool is near saturation the fixed fee of 340 ADA will play a miniscule role, so the variable fee will then be very close to 4.0%. The variable fee will be exactly 4.0% when the fixed fee is no longer mandatory and STR8 can reduce the fixed fee to 0.
          </p>
          <p>
          STR8 pools low 4% effective reward fee is actually 0.2% cost for delegators per annum if the gross expected ROS is 5%. Please remember crypto can fluctuate 2-10% per day, so I believe STR8 has very competitive fees. 
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">Where do I get updates on this pool?</h4>
          <p>Updates are posted on <a href="https://twitter.com/Straightpool4">Twitter</a> and in the <a href="https://t.me/str8pool">Straightpool Telegram group</a>.</p>
          <p>Currently, there are no plans to setup a mailing list for delegators as it is plausible Shelley mainnet will have some form of wallet messaging in the official wallets from stakepool operator to stakepool delegators. We have enough email spam already, I would like to minimize any further spam by not contributing to collect yet another mailing list prone to abuse.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">What is the name origin of this pool?</h4>
          <p>Straight in the sense of straightforward, straight ahead, straight high quality audio, no gimmicks, just works.</p>
