<p>
The "Cardano Straight ADA Stakepool" (Ticker: STR8) aims to secure the Cardano network by running a competitive 24/7 pool on decentralized infrastructure maintained by IT professionals. 
The fees ensure longevity and sustainability of the pool, there is no other purpose, thus the name of our pool. 
This pool does not aim to heal the world, the intention is to provide reliable Cardano infrastructure / protocol service with high desirability for you as a delegator. 
Website is static, mobile-friendly and simple, as time spend on stakepool operations is more valuable than creating and maintaining a fancy website.
</p>
Delegate your stake to us, and we will pay you high rewards. It is risk free to delegate your stake, and you will earn interest by simply holding your ADA.

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this pool you can find me, the operator in Telegram under the name @Slacker1 in all the relevant Cardano channels.

<h2>FAQ</h2> 

<h3>About the operator</h3>
I am an IT professional with many years of experience in maintaining servers. Running a pool is more fun to me than a challenge. Who would you rather task with staking your ADA?
As a technical person, I was drawn to Cardano in 2017 and have followed the protocol ever since and am happy to provide this service to the community fostering network growth & strength.
The pool is run in an anonymous fashion, in order make it impossible to influence me. This is part of the security, to make it much harder to attack the pool.

<h3>About the pool itself</h3>
The pool is run off a reliable, redundant virtual private server located in Europe / crypto-friendly Germany with an SLA of 99.95%, within the stable minimum hardware requirements specified by IOHK ensuring smooth operation.

<h3>Fee structure</h3> 
<p>
I decided to build only on the profit margin, not the pool costs, to run our infrastructure. My reason is solidarity with you, my highly appreciated delegator. By relying soly on profit margins, we share the risk. I belive in Cardano and we are in this togther. If your stake is doing well, the pool reward is going well. We share the good days, we share the bad days.
</p>
<p>
The pool profit margin is merely 5% of your reward, you keep 95% of your reward. Please note we are talking about reward, not your staking amount. That's it, I hope you do find this competitive. Running a stakepool must be worth it, or everyone would just delegate to a central server and we lose one of the core goals of Cardano: Decentralization.
</p>
<p>
I will not suddenly raise my fees like what other pools starting with unsustainable fee structures must eventually do. As a delegator I want to give you peace of mind delegating to my pool.
</p>
<h3>Updates</h3>
Updates will be posted in the section "News Ticker", should there be any of relevance to you as a delegator. 

<p>Currently, there are no plans to setup a mailing list for delegators as it is plausible Shelley mainnet will have some form of wallet messaging in the official wallets from stakepool operator to stakepool delegators. We have enough email spam already, I would like to minimize any further spam by not contributing to collect yet another mailing list prone to abuse.</p>

<h3>Name origin</h3>
<p>Straight in the sense of straightforward, straight high quality audio, no gimmicks, just works.</p>
