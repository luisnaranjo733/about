<p>
The "Cardano Straight ADA Stakepool" aims to secure the Cardano network by running a competitive 24/7 pool on decentralized infrastructure maintained by IT professionals. 
The low fees ensure longevity and sustainability of the pool, there is no other purpose, thus the name of our pool. 
This pool intention is to provide reliable Cardano infrastructure / protocol service with high desirability for you as a delegator. 
</p>
Delegate your stake to us, and we will pay you high rewards. It is risk free to delegate your stake, and you will earn interest by simply holding your ADA.

<h2>News Ticker</h2>
<h3>2019-12-29 Hardware upgrade and fee reduction</h3>

<h3>2019-12-23 Pooltool Blockheight Tip</h3>
Straightpool now reports current blockheight to pooltool.io, here you can always track that Straightpool is in sync and performing well.

<h2>FAQ</h2> 

<h3>Who operates the pool?</h3>
I am an IT professional with computer science background, with many years in the IT business. 
<p>Whilst running and maintaining servers is just a hobby of mine, I engage in this way with multiple communities in see value in. I bring many years of experience in maintaining Linux based servers. Running a pool is more fun to me than a serious challenge.</p>
<p>The pool is run in an anonymous fashion, in order to make it impossible to influence me. This is part of the security, to make it much harder to attack the pool.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</br>

<h3>What is your history with the Cardano project?</h3>
As a technical person, I was drawn to Cardano in 2017 through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja9D0kpksxw">Charles' whiteboard video</a> and have followed the protocol ever since, watching AMAs and the like almost every day on the way to work and back. 

<p>I see a lot of potential in Cardano due to its strong vision and methodical process, so I am very happy to provide the service of running a reliable stakepool for the community fostering network growth & strength.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</br>

<h3>What is the setup of your pool?</h3>
The pool is run off a reliable, redundant virtual private server located in Europe / crypto-friendly Germany with an SLA of 99.95%, with hardware spec double the stable minimum hardware requirements specified by IOHK ensuring smooth operation. 
<p>The pool is running on Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS with 2 cores, 8 GB RAM, 80 GB HDD and 100 Mbps internet with no cap.</p>
<p>I do not want to bore you with real-time monitoring data of my pool, you can just expect that the pool works for you 24/7. Of course within the testnet the pool can only run as stable as the software stability allows, but I will do my best and moving forward  code stability will improve for sure.</p> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;</br>

<h3>What are your plans for the future of your pool?</h3>
<p>I am running this pool because I believe in Cardano's future and want to be a part of it. For this reason, I plan to run this pool for the long term with no end in mind. At the core of any community is communication, so I will try my best to keep this website updated with any new information that comes up. Additionally, I am available on Telegram.</p>

<p>I am currently very active in the <a href="https://t.me/CardanoStakePoolWorkgroup">Cardano Shelley Testnet & StakePool Best Practice Workgroup Telegram channel</a> trying to help grow the community and implement all best practices for this pool and develop new best practices along the way.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</br>

<h3>Why should I delegate to your pool?</h3>
<p>My hope is that my pool has high desirability for you as a delegator. I am committed to run this pool indefinitely with reasonable but low fees for testnet as well as mainnet.</p> 
<p>
I decided to build only on the profit margin, not the pool costs, to run the infrastructure. So there will never be any fixed cost at this pool. My reason is solidarity with you, my highly appreciated delegator. By relying soly on profit margin, we share the risk. I belive in Cardano and we are in this togther. If your stake is doing well, the pool reward is going well. We share the good days, we share the bad days.
</p>
<p>
The pool profit margin is merely 4% of your reward, you keep 96% of your reward. Please note we are talking about reward, not your staking amount.
</p>
<p>
I will not suddenly raise my fees like what other pools starting with unsustainable fee structures will eventually do. As a delegator I want to give you peace of mind delegating to my pool all the way from testnet on to mainnet.
</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</br>

<h3>Where do I get updates on this pool?</h3>
Updates of relevance to you as a delegator will be posted in the section "News Ticker".

<p>Currently, there are no plans to setup a mailing list for delegators as it is plausible Shelley mainnet will have some form of wallet messaging in the official wallets from stakepool operator to stakepool delegators. We have enough email spam already, I would like to minimize any further spam by not contributing to collect yet another mailing list prone to abuse.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</br>

<h3>What is the name origin of this pool?</h3>
<p>Straight in the sense of straightforward, straight ahead, straight high quality audio, no gimmicks, just works.</p>
